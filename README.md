# SecretSantaRandomizer

Playing Secret Santa is fun. More fun when you play it with close friends.
But now with friends in different city, how do you decide who gives gift to whom. Such that it remain anonymous as well. You can't pick up the chits from the bowl. 

Well there might be several methods, I decided to develop some fairly simple and easy Python script for it.

The provided script generates random number and creates matches for Secret Santa based on that. On matching it sends an automated email to the Secret Santa as to whom they have to send gifts to.

The script is written and tested in Python3.7. It uses "random" and "smtp" libraries both of which are default libraries in Python.

Have Fun!
